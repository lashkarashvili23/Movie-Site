## Movie Site

### Description
Movie Site is a simple web application that allows users to browse and discover movies. Users can view movie details, including the title, poster, release year, and rating. The application does not use an API. It reads data from a JavaScript object and generates HTML according to it. PS: It doesn't play actual movies (because it's illegal) it plays YouTube trailers of them.
